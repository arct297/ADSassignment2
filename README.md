# Data Structures Implementation in Java

This repository contains a collection of Java classes implementing various fundamental data structures.

## Contents

- `Main.java`: Contains the main method to run examples of data structure usage.
- `MyArrayList.java`: Custom implementation of an array list.
- `MyLinkedList.java`: Custom implementation of a singly linked list.
- `MyList.java`: Interface defining the list operations.
- `MyMinHeap.java`: Implementation of a minimum heap (min-heap).
- `MyQueue.java`: Custom implementation of a queue using linked list.
- `MyStack.java`: Custom implementation of a stack.

## Usage

Each data structure can be instantiated and used in your Java application. The `Main.java` file includes examples of how to work with each data structure.

To compile the classes, use the following command:

```sh
javac *.java
